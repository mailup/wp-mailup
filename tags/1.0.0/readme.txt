* create unlimited event-based messages
* define when they are active
* define when how often they will be sent (e.g. daily, monthly, annually, one-time)
* define which events trigger the sending of the message by combining multiple filters (e.g. send second message if first message was not opened; or send a welcome message N days after subscription)
* send the event-based message to a specific group or to any subscriber
* send triggered email messages based on recipient behavior (open, click, bounce, time, subscription)
* send triggered sms messages based on email and ecommerce data
